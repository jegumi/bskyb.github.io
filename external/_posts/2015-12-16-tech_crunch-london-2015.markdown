excerpt: "TechCrunch Disrupt is the world’s leading authority in debuting revolutionary startups, introducing game-changing technologies, and discussing what’s top of mind for the tech industry’s key innovators. Disrupt gathers the best and brightest entrepreneurs, investors, hackers, and tech fans for on-stage interviews, the Startup Battlefield competition, a 24-hour Hackathon, Startup Alley, Hardware Alley, and After Parties. Sky had a stand where the company was promoted and was attracting talent to join our ranks, and some of our developers were there. Here is a brief summary of the event."

    <p>On the 7th and 8th of December I attended to Tech Crunch Disrupt as part of the Sky team. It was a nice experience, even thinking that this is an event completely focused on startups.</p>

    <p><img  alt="Sky stand" height="250" width="333" src="/images/identity/techcrunch/tech_crunch_stand.jpg" title="Sky stand"></p>

	<p>Sky built a nice stand with the Iron Throne, and a game "Hunt the Throne", where people were invited to guest the location of the Throne. If the adjective to define the standups on the startups alley was narrow, we cannot say that about the Sky one. The bigger one and the most attractive with a great difference.</p>

	<p>There were a continuous flow of people visiting the stand, taking pictures in the Throne, and playing the game, but at least on Monday and Tuesday, there weren't developers. People with business background, visitors, or guys that were at the event presenting their startup. Regarding to HR (I couldn't be there the weekend), on Saturday and Sunday the thing was completely different. These days the visitors were developers participating on the Hackhaton, and probably these two days were the most productive in terms of attracting talent to the company.</p>

	<p>As I said, Tech Crunch Disrupt is an event completely focused on startups. You can differentiate three kinds of profiles there, startups, investors, companies offering services to startups. All of them mixing together in the startup alley. Two lines of narrow stands where the startups tried to capture the attention of investors. You can notice their pressure talking with the right people. When some developer asked for their product they explained it as fast as they can, without too many passion, just hoping the next visitor has a different profile.</p>

	<p>On the stage, during the morning, the founders stories. Succesful founders as Taavet Hinrikus (TransferWise) or William Shu (Deliveroo) were explaining how they success, and what are the plans for their companies. Unicorn was the word most repeated by the moderators. Unicorn is the word used to describe the companies with a valuation of 1 billion dollars. There were some well know unicorns on the stage. Investors were very present at the stage too. All the big firms operating in Europe were there, big names of Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Accel partners, Passion Capital, etc where there talking about valuation and the startups ecosystem in Europe mainly. Sir Alex Ferguson was there too talking about leadership, and althougt the interview was great, and he is a really interesting man, I'm still thinking that it was a bit ouf of place in a tech conference as Tech Crunch Disrupt.</p>

	<p>After the long queue for lunch, more than 40 minutes to take something to eat. In fact they change the time of the presentation after lunch, probably because not too many people had time to eat on time, it was turn to watch the startup battefield. 15 startups were fighthing for 4 places on the Tuesday final. The majority of them with an impressive story telling pitch and with a clear messages. But some of them with a weak business model that created too many doubts replying the questions from the judges (a mix of founders and investors). </p>

	<p>The most appealing pitch was from the guys from Jukedeck. These guys not only have a great product, an AI music generator for movies, and a massive market, if not they make the audience clap as they were in a concert when one of the founders rap their pitch. Judges were impresive for the product and clearly these guys has a lot of chances to be in the selected 4 startups for the final. Max, a motorbike delivering service for Africa, was too comented too. Very dissapointing the demo of Ollie, not working, probably because of the bad connectivity in the place, a robot that interacts with the user should have waken up when the user was close, but we had to watch it on video.</p>

	<p>Thierry Henry talking about the company he has invested, Grabyo, founder by an ex Sky employee closed a great day.</p>

	<p>Second day, the startups alley full of hardware startups, from showers, to drones, everything was possible. On the stage, more founders stories (BlaBlaCar, Twilio, Wallapop)and the battlefield final. This day was not very different to the previous one, but everybody was focued on the battelfield final. The finalist were Jukedeck, Lystable, Max and Yoobic.</p>
