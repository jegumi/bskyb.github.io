	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Across four days in early December, Sky were present at the Copper Box Arena in Stratford for TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015. The event was split into two halves, with a Hackathon running for 24 hours from Saturday afternoon onwards and a more traditional conference taking place on the Monday and Tuesday. Representatives from many areas of Sky Technology were present, and were able to listen to talks from industry leaders, make a lot of interesting connections and interact first-hand with a number of exciting startups from across Europe.</p>

	<p>As the Hackathon started on Saturday, the first task was to try and convince teams to work on the Sky hack. One of the developers in the Content Discovery team, Kola Adewuyi, had created a set of learned actions that could be combined with our programme metadata and image archives, and we were looking for ingenious ways that these could be used to intelligently recommend new Sky shows to customers. The team that we judged had the best hack using this data would win four 4K Samsung TVs, as well as Now TV subscriptions. It quickly garnered a lot of interest, and we were soon talking to lots of developers about some really exciting ideas. 10 teams signed up to our hack, and they were soon stuck in to the code. The Hackathon ran for 24 hours, with pizza provided overnight- there were a lot of tired eyes the next morning, as well as long queues for coffee! As the teams were finishing up it was obvious that lots of really cool ideas had been put into practice, and our judging panel was assembled. Martin O'Hagan, an iOS developer on the judging panel, said that "some great Sky hacks came out of it, and I met lots of people interested in working for Sky".</p>

	<p>Come Monday morning the arena had been transformed, with the floor now covered in stands for startups to showcase their products. As these companies were trying to pitch to anybody who walked past, a number of panels were also occurring behind a vast curtain in the arena: these included a very diverse set of speakers, ranging from Sir Alex Ferguson to Imogen Heap. Sky representatives alternated between exploring the conference and helping out on the stand, talking about the cool products being built and the technology behind them. There were devices showcasing Sky Go, Sky Store and Now TV, and lots of questions from people excited about Sky Q. The most popular part of the stand (and possibly of the conference!) had to be the Iron Throne, with hundreds of people getting their photo taken on it. There were also lots of entrants to the stand's Game Of Thrones-themed game, where you had to guess the location of the Iron Throne on an interactive map to try and win an Apple Watch. By the end of the conference a lot of interesting people had stopped by the stall to talk- Katharine Fitzpatrick, a Sky developer who had travelled down from Leeds to be present, said that "It was really inspiring to see so many innovative startups and meet people who were following their dreams".<p>

	<h2>Personal View - Jesus Gumiel</h2>

    <p>On the 7th and 8th of December I attended to Tech Crunch Disrupt as part of the Sky team. It was a nice experience, even thinking that this is an event completely focused on startups.</p>

    <p><img  alt="Sky stand" height="250" width="333" src="/images/identity/techcrunch/tech_crunch_stand.jpg" title="Sky stand"></p>

	<p>Sky built a nice stand with the Iron Throne, and a game "Hunt the Throne", where people were invited to guess the location of the Throne. If the adjective to define the standups on the startups alley was narrow, we cannot say that about the Sky stand, one of the bigger and more attractive stands</p>
	<p>There were a continuous flow of people visiting the stand, taking pictures in the Throne, and playing the game, but at least on Monday and Tuesday, there weren't developers. People with business backgrounds, visitors, or companies that were at the event presenting their startup. Regarding to HR (I couldn't be there the weekend), on Saturday and Sunday the event was completely different. These days the visitors were developers participating on the Hackhaton, and probably these two days were the most productive in terms of attracting talent to the company.</p>
	<p>As I said, Tech Crunch Disrupt is an event completely focused on startups. You can differentiate three kinds of profiles there, startups, investors and companies offering services to startups - all of them mixing together in the startup alley. There were two lines of narrow stands where the startups tried to capture the attention of investors, and you could notice the pressure talking to the right people. When some developer asked about their product they explained it as fast as they can, without too many passion, just hoping the next visitor has a different profile.</p>
	<p>On the stage, during the morning, the founders stories. Succesful founders as Taavet Hinrikus (TransferWise) or William Shu (Deliveroo) were explaining how they succeed, and what are the plans for their companies. Unicorn was the word most repeated by the moderators. Unicorn is the word used to describe the companies with a valuation of 1 billion dollars. There were some well know unicorns on the stage. Investors were very present at the stage too. All the big firms operating in Europe were there, big names of Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Accel partners, Passion Capital, etc where there talking about valuation and the startups ecosystem in Europe mainly. Sir Alex Ferguson was there too talking about leadership, and althoug the interview was great, and he is a really interesting man, I'm still thinking that it was a bit ouf of place in a tech conference Tech Crunch Disrupt.</p>

	<p>After the long queue for lunch, more than 40 minutes to take something to eat, it should have been an interview with Thierry Henry, but it was moved to the end of the day, probably because not too many people had eaten at the time the talk was scheduled. So, change of plans, and time to watch the startup battefield. 15 startups were fighthing for 4 places on the Tuesday final. The majority of them with an impressive story trying to pitch and with a clear messages. But some of them with a weak business model that created too many doubts replying to the questions from the judges (a mix of founders and investors). </p>
	<p>The most appealing pitch was from the guys from Jukedeck. These guys not only have a great product, an AI music generator for movies, and a massive market, if not they make the audience clap as they were in a concert when one of the founders rap their pitch. Judges were impressed with the product and clearly these guys has a lot of chances to be in the selected 4 startups for the final. Max, a motorbike delivering service for Africa, was other of the startups with a lot of chances to be on the stage the next day. On the other hand, the dissapointing demo of Ollie, not working, probably because of the bad connectivity in the place, a robot that interacts with the user should have waken up when the user was close, but we had to watch it on video.</p>
	<p>Thierry Henry talking about the company he has invested, Grabyo, founder by an ex Sky employee closed a great day.</p>

	<p>Second day, the startups alley full of hardware startups, from showers, to drones. On the stage, more founders stories (BlaBlaCar, Twilio, Wallapop) and the battlefield final. This day was not very different to the previous one, but everybody was focued on the battelfield final. The finalist were Jukedeck, Lystable, Max and Yoobic.</p>

	<h2>Personal View - Michael Tweed</h2>
	<p>Working in an office all day, it's possible to end up somewhat removed from the global burgeoning tech scene. These four days, however, got me as close as is possible to the people and ideas that have the potential to dominate over the next few years. As I arrived to a long queue for the Hackathon on the Saturday - by the end of which I could barely feel my hands- you could sense the excitement among those waiting to get in. Once inside the first few hours were spent talking to developers, finding out what sort of ideas they had and encouraging them to work on the Sky hack as they formed themselves into teams. After the 24 hours had elapsed, it was amazing how much had been accomplished by the 76 teams present. Some teams were able to implement natural language processing, as well as integrating with a number of really cool APIs (including Sky's of course…). The winners can be seen <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/06/disrupt-london-2015-hackathon-winners">here</a>.</p>

	<p>As I queued on the Monday morning (thankfully moving far quicker than on Saturday), there were a noticeably different set of attendees, with hoodies and backpacks replaced with press passes and briefcases. Walking towards the Sky stand, I was pitched by two startups before I'd even taken my coat off, which I think sums up the conference pretty well. I spent a lot of the next two days at the Sky stand, talking to people about the sort of stuff we build, and it was really interesting talking to people who had travelled from all over Europe (notably Denmark, Sweden and Germany), getting their opinions on Sky and the media industry at large in their respective countries. I was also able to attend a few of the panels, where I listened to successful startup founders and venture capitalists talk about their experiences and where they think the industry is heading. Any other spare time I had was spent walking around what was termed ‘Startup Alley', which was exactly as it sounds like, with lots of stalls packed closely together. There was an incredible range of products and technology on show, from app security services to smart showers to personalised drones to makeup apps.</p>

	<p>A large chunk of the conference on Tuesday was dominated by the finals of the Startup Battlefield, with four of the leading startups from the conference pitching to a panel of expert judges to win the £30,000 prize. The eventual winners were Jukedeck, a company that provides ‘artificial intelligence music composition technology', and the runners-up were Metro Africa Xpress, an on-demand delivery service based in Nigeria. With this announcement the conference drew to a close, and I left with a plethora of business cards and ideas to explore. I have to thank Jenna Benedict and Carol McLaughlin, who organised Sky's sponsorship for the event and made sure the stand ran smoothly and successfully for the four days.</p>
